# Predicting-Rotten-Tomato-Rating
This was a project done with my group in a course titled ME379M: Data Science for Engineers.
The question we were trying to answer was what aspects of a movie caused high rotten tomato rating? And subsequently, we wanted to explore whether we could predict rotten tomato ratings given historical data?
The answer was yes it is possible. We used linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict our rotten tomato ratings. Then we performed a SHAP chart to explain the results we got from those regression models.
